## Projects
### Academic Projects: 

### Programming and Data Visualization With Python 
**Network Analysis** 
In this project, I analyzed London's Underground Network to pinpoint critical stations using centrality measures. By plotting the network and calculating Degree, Betweenness, and Eigenvector centralities, I identified vulnerable stations. Visualizations and network attacks were employed to assess network resilience, with findings detailed in a comprehensive report.

**Spatial Analysis**
I conducted spatial analysis to assess earthquake impact on population and buildings globally. By gathering earthquake data, building footprints, and population counts, I defined concentric rings around epicenters to gauge the extent of impact. Additionally, I proposed street network-based escape routes. Results, including population and building impact tables, were compiled in a detailed report.

**Geographic Machine Learning**
I performed spatial cluster analysis on Airbnb listings to examine location and price effects on review scores. By applying the DBSCAN algorithm, I clustered listings based on bedrooms, price, and review scores. The analysis featured cluster plots, maps, and a succinct report interpreting the clustering outcomes.

### Diversity in Business Venues using PostgreSQL
I analyzed substance provision places in a selected region to support business diversity while avoiding concentrations of fast food outlets. Using OpenStreetMap data, I collected and ingested venue information into a PostgreSQL database, followed by initial exploration and data cleaning. Basic wrangling involved spatial operations and amenity counts per geography. Further cleaning included imputing missing cuisine values using a KNN approach for specific areas. Recommendations, presented in a concise report, emphasized promoting business diversity and avoiding fast food clusters, supported by maps, plots, and additional analysis.


### Accessibility Disparities in Manchester District using R and R5R packages
I conducted an analysis of socio-spatial inequalities in the Manchester District, focusing on accessibility disparities for two Supergroups. Utilizing the Output Area Classification (OAC) 2021, I selected specific areas and calculated accessibility metrics, including cumulative opportunity, at various cut-off time thresholds and different hours on weekdays and weekends. I examined accessibility to key amenities to schools and supermarkets constructing a comprehensive profile of accessibility disparities between the two Supergroups. The analysis delved into how accessibility metrics fluctuate throughout the day and between weekdays and weekends, considering the diverse needs of different social groups within each area as outlined in the OAC documentation.
