## Projects
### Academic Projects: 

### Dissertation:Crime Seasonality Analysis Across UK Cities Using Time Series Models
I conducted an in-depth analysis of crime seasonality in five UK cities (Newcastle, Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol, and Plymouth) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing time-series crime data from June 2013–May 2019 and June 2022–May 2024. The project applied STL decomposition to uncover seasonal patterns, and I used KNN clustering to identify common crime trends. To forecast post-pandemic crime patterns, I employed SARIMA, Prophet, ETS, and GRU models, comparing their effectiveness. SARIMA outperformed other models due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.

### Programming and Data Visualization With Python 
**Network Analysis** 
In this project, I analyzed London's Underground Network to pinpoint critical stations using centrality measures. By plotting the network and calculating Degree, Betweenness, and Eigenvector centralities, I identified vulnerable stations. Visualizations and network attacks were employed to assess network resilience, with findings detailed in a comprehensive report.

**Spatial Analysis**
I conducted spatial analysis to assess earthquake impact on population and buildings globally. By gathering earthquake data, building footprints, and population counts, I defined concentric rings around epicenters to gauge the extent of impact. Additionally, I proposed street network-based escape routes. Results, including population and building impact tables, were compiled in a detailed report.

**Geographic Machine Learning**
I performed spatial cluster analysis on Airbnb listings to examine location and price effects on review scores. By applying the DBSCAN algorithm, I clustered listings based on bedrooms, price, and review scores. The analysis featured cluster plots, maps, and a succinct report interpreting the clustering outcomes.

### Diversity in Business Venues using PostgreSQL
I analyzed substance provision places in a selected region to support business diversity while avoiding concentrations of fast food outlets. Using OpenStreetMap data, I collected and ingested venue information into a PostgreSQL database, followed by initial exploration and data cleaning. Basic wrangling involved spatial operations and amenity counts per geography. Further cleaning included imputing missing cuisine values using a KNN approach for specific areas. Recommendations, presented in a concise report, emphasized promoting business diversity and avoiding fast food clusters, supported by maps, plots, and additional analysis. The maps for this project was created by QGIS.

### Accessibility Disparities in Manchester District using R and R5R packages
I conducted an analysis of socio-spatial inequalities in the Manchester District, focusing on accessibility disparities for two Supergroups. Utilizing the Output Area Classification (OAC) 2021, I selected specific areas and calculated accessibility metrics, including cumulative opportunity, at various cut-off time thresholds and different hours on weekdays and weekends. I examined accessibility to key amenities to schools and supermarkets constructing a comprehensive profile of accessibility disparities between the two Supergroups. The analysis delved into how accessibility metrics fluctuate throughout the day and between weekdays and weekends, considering the diverse needs of different social groups within each area as outlined in the OAC documentation.

### Analyzing Spatial Relationships in Electric Vehicles Recharge Station Distribution Using ArcGIS pro, R and GeoDa
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis focusing on the spatial distribution of Electric Vehicle (EV) recharge stations in London boroughs, considering various socio-economic, environmental, and demographic factors. Data collection involved compiling a comprehensive dataset from diverse sources, including the National Charge Point Registry, Statista, OpenStreetMap, and the London Datastore, to explore the relationship between public EV recharge points and relevant variables such as population density, income levels, transportation emissions, and street infrastructure. Through point pattern analysis, global and local Moran’s I statistics, correlation analysis, data transformation, and **exploratory and OLS regression**, I delved into understanding the spatial patterns and determinants of recharge station distribution. The findings highlighted significant correlations between recharge station distribution and variables like EV owner density, population density, and street area ratio. Moreover, the **spatial regression analysis**, particularly the *Spatial Lag Model*, emerged as the most effective in explaining 63.3% of the variance in recharge station numbers, considering spatial dependency.
